### Sofia and Xoeseko's AR proof of concept

Our aim is to demonstrate that it would be possible to learn skills through augmented or virtual reality.

#### Steps to achieve our goal:
- [x] Using motion capture to get an animation of a skill we want to transmit. (Tai-chi for the proof of concept)
- [x] Rigging a character to follow the motion capture animation
- [x] Importing the animation into unity in order to develop the AR or VR application.
- [ ] Having a working prototype
- [ ] Testing within our close circles what people think of the concept
- [ ] Making a presentative video for the project

#### Sources:
We aim as much as possible to make use of open access software and assets.
The motion capture for example comes from the carnegie mellon university [motion capture library](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu).
