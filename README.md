### Sofia and Xoeseko's AR proof of concept

Our aim is to demonstrate that it would be possible to learn skills through augmented or virtual reality. 

#### Steps to achieve our goal:
- [x] Using motion capture to get an animation of a skill we want to transmit. (Tai-chi for the proof of concept)
- [ ] Rigging a character to follow the motion capture animation
- [ ] Importing the animation into unity in order to develop the AR or VR application.
- [ ] Testing within our close circles what people think of the concept

#### Sources:
We aim as much as possible to make use of open access software and assets. 
The motion capture for example comes from the carnegie mellon university [motion capture library](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu).
